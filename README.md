# Portfolio-Node-Generator

If anyone ever wants to look at the application, they'll have to clone it to their own local machine and run it from there, so it's really important you create a solid README.md file with instructions and explanations for how to use this application.

##To recap this lesson:

We now know how to use the fs module to copy files from one location to another.

We've created our own JavaScript Promises to handle asynchronous functionality in a cleaner fashion.

And to recap the entire module:

We understand the purpose of Node.js and some of its uses in web development.

We know how to create and execute a Node.js application.

We learned a bit about the process for new features to be introduced into JavaScript and who is in charge of it (Ecma).

We can use new means of creating variables and functions in JavaScript.

We know a new way to concatenate variable data into strings using template literals along with some other new ES6 features such as destructuring and spread/rest operators.

We can modularize the Node.js applications to enhance code readability and reusability.

We know that Node.js has built-in tools and how to use them if we need to, such as the fs library.

We understand how and why to use the npm init command to create Node.js packages that are dependent on outside tools and libraries such as Inquirer.

We can use new array methods with object destructuring and arrow function implicit returns to create succinct and readable code.

We can identify where the asynchronous functionality can be cleaned up and how to turn callback functions into JavaScript Promise objects.
